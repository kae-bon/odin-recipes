<!-- In this project, I'll be building a basic recipe site in order to test the skills I've learned in the HTML Foundations course on The Odin Project! 

I hope to code a well-formed website with proper syntax, and to explore usage of the elements I've learned thus far. 

I'll also try to use the command line on my computer as much as possible to work with this project to practice with the command line. -->
